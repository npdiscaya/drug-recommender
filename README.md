## About Dataset
This dataset was used for the Winter 2018 Kaggle University Club Hackathon and is now publicly available. See Acknowledgments section for citation and licensing. Note: The types of data and recommendation based solutions provided by the contestants are purely for NLP learning purposes. They are not suitable for a real world drug recommendations solutions.

Machine learning has permeated nearly all fields and disciplines of study. One hot topic is using natural language processing and sentiment analysis to identify, extract, and make use of subjective information. The UCI ML Drug Review dataset provides patient reviews on specific drugs along with related conditions and a 10-star patient rating system reflecting overall patient satisfaction. The data was obtained by crawling online pharmaceutical review sites. This data was published in a study on sentiment analysis of drug experience over multiple facets, ex. sentiments learned on specific aspects such as effectiveness and side effects (see the acknowledgments section to learn more).

## Objective
Here are just a couple ideas as to what you could do with the data:

* Classification: Can you predict the patient's condition based on the review?
* Regression: Can you predict the rating of the drug based on the review?
* Sentiment analysis: What elements of a review make it more helpful to others? Which patients tend to have more negative reviews? Can you determine if a review is positive, neutral, or negative?
* Data visualizations: What kind of drugs are there? What sorts of conditions do these patients have?
